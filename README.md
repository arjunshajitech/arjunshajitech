<p align="center">I’m a Software Engineer from Kerala (God’s Own Country) with a strong passion for real-time communication technologies. I specialize in building systems using WebRTC, RTP, and other RTC protocols, focusing on low-latency, high-performance communication. I enjoy working on projects that push the boundaries of my skills—whether it’s building SFUs, optimizing media pipelines, or diving deep into network-level debugging. Always curious and hands-on, I love learning new technologies and crafting reliable, scalable solutions.</p>
